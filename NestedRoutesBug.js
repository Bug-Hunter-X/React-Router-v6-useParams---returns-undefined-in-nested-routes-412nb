In React Router Dom v6, a common issue arises when working with nested routes and route parameters.  If you have a route like `/users/:userId/profile` and attempt to access `useParams().userId` within a component nested several levels deep, the value might be undefined. This happens when the component rendering is not directly nested within the route matching `/users/:userId`. The value is missing in the context.
