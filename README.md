This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Router v6 where `useParams()` returns undefined when used within deeply nested routes. The bug arises from the component's position relative to the route containing the parameter. The solution shows how to correctly structure nested routes to ensure `useParams()` functions as expected. The problem and its solution are explained in detail in the respective JavaScript files.
